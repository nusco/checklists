checklists
==========

A quick Ruby script to generate HTML checklists from a text file.

To use:

    checklists <filename> <output_folder>
    
The default filename is *checklists.txt*, and the default output folder is *output*.
Keep in mind that the output folder will be destroyed and recreated every time.
